## üìñ Introduction

Manual analysis of dental X-ray images is often time-consuming, prone to human error, and subject to inter-observer variability. This project aims to automate this process, providing dentists and researchers with a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale analysis of dental morphology.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Automate the identification of individual teeth** within dental X-ray images, focusing on the lower jaw region.
2. **Accurately determine positions and labels** of each identified tooth.
3. **Extract precise morphological measurements** such as length, width, angle, and apex condition.
4. **Classify and quantify tooth morphology** to aid in dental research and clinical diagnosis.
5. **Streamline diagnostic workflows** and enhance the efficiency of dental care services through automated analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project employs two YOLOv8 models:
- **Tooth Detection Model:** Detects the tooth area within dental X-ray images.
- **Instance Segmentation Model:** Identifies individual lower jaw teeth within the detected tooth area.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Preprocessing:** Optimize dental X-ray images by resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
2. **Annotation:** Label individual teeth using Roboflow software and apply augmentations.
3. **Dataset Splitting:** Divide the dataset for training, validation, and testing (70-20-10 split).
4. **Model Training:** Use YOLOv8 architectures for accurate tooth detection and segmentation.
5. **Prediction:** Apply trained models to identify each tooth in new X-ray images.
6. **Post-processing:** Extract morphological features like length, width, angle.

### Technology Stack:
- **Deep Learning:** YOLOv8
- **Web Framework:** Python Django, HTML, CSS
- **Database:** MySQL
